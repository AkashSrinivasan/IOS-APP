***completionHandler***

    * The completion handler to call when the load request is complete. This handler is executed on the delegate queue.

    * If you pass nil, only the session delegate methods are called when the task completes, making this method equivalent to the dataTask(with:) method.

    * This completion handler takes the following parameters:

   ** data:
        The data returned by the server.
        
        
   ** response:
        An object that provides response metadata, such as HTTP headers and status code. If you are making an HTTP or HTTPS request, the returned object is actually an HTTPURLResponse object.
   
   
   error:
        An error object that indicates why the request failed, or nil if the request was successful.
