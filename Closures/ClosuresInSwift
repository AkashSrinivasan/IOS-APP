1.Closures in Swift 4 are similar to that of self-contained functions organized as blocks 
  and called anywhere like C and Objective C languages. 
2.Constants and variable references defined inside the functions are captured and stored in closures.



Syntax
{
   (parameters) âˆ’> return type in
   statements
}




Here, $0 and $1 refer to the closure's first and second String arguments.
